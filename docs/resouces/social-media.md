# Social Media Accounts

Social media is a great way to interact with other FIRST teams, the community, and to spread the word about everything the team is doing! It should be fun, but professional. We can push progress updates, show pictures of the team designing/building, and start discussions about the game.

## Extended Code of Conduct

Social media accounts are run by the team, and are a reflection of the team and St. Joe's as a community. **This means we must act professional and courteous at all times**, or else any violators will lose social media access, and possibly lose it for the team as a whole.

## Accounts

Below are the social media accounts we currently manage. All access is managed via [credentials stored in LastPass](./credentials).

### Facebook

[The Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/frc5590/) is great for giving Status/Progress Updates, and really anything else that we can think of. It's not so much for dialogue, but to post about the team's doings.

### Instagram

Instagram is good for posting update pictures of the design, build, and completion of the robot, along with pictures of the team working together.

### Twitter

Twitter is awesome for short little blurbs about the team, funny questions and interacting with other teams, posting images of updates, and receiving rules updates from FIRST.

### Website

[The website](https://alumiboti5590.com) is where we share the team's information, show off our sponsors, and link to our other social media accounts. If you are interested in editing it and the content, please reach out to a mentor and they will point you in the right direction.
