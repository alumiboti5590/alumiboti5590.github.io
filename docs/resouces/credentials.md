# Team Credentials & Secret Management

The Alumiboti have multiple credentials across many different services that we
interact with, such as our [social media](./social-media), CAD programs, GitHub,
and more.

## LastPass

To manage credentials across individuals and the team, we have a shared [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) account that is responsible for storing the username, email, and password credentials for any services that the team interacts with.

### Getting Access to LastPass

To get access to LastPass, please reach out to a mentor.

## Best Practices

### Random Passwords

When creating a new account or credential, it is important to generate **unique, random passwords**. This ensures
that the effected radius in the event of a password leak is reduced.

To generate passwords, either use [the generator built into LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator-a) or use [Random.org](https://www.random.org/passwords/).

### Consolidated Email

If an account is going to be used across the team, then it is preferred to use the `robotics@sjci.com` email address to
be consistent across all accounts.

### Save Credentials Into LastPass

Whenever you create a new team-wide account, _please_ put the credentials into LastPass as quickly as possible. If you are using the [Chrome Extension for LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=en-US), it should automatically prompt you to add/update the credentials.
