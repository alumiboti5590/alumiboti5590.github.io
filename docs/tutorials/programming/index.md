# Programming Tutorials

A critical part of working with FIRST is being able to program the robots so they actual follow
what we want them to do. We can build a cool robot, but if it doesn't move, then it doesn't do
much for us! The following sections will walk you through different aspects of learning how to
program in general, how to build the code needed for a robot, and how to share project code
together.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
