# Student Contract

:::caution Required Information

All perspective students must read the following and confirm a Google Form that states they understand what is expected of them to continue participation with the robotics team.

:::

The Alumiboti are committed to being individuals of integrity and ensuring that our team stays in good standing with St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute, the local community, and the FIRST Robotics organization as a whole. To ensure this, we ask that students and mentors follow the team rules below.

:::danger Failure to Comply

Failure to follow the rules or be caught breaking rules on multiple occassions may result in your removal from the robotics team and communication with the school and/or your parents as to what occurred.

:::

## Rules & Guidelines

The following are adaptations from [Team 971](https://frc971.org/content/TeamRulesAndExpectations) and [Team 1828](https://www.1828boxerbots.org/docs/Handbook%20Contract.pdf).

### Leadership

I understand that the team coach and St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute have final authority over all matters related to the team. I understand that if there are any concerns I have with the team, I should raise them to the team coach or an administrator at the school.

### Gracious Professionalism

I agree to practice Gracious Professionalism in all my interactions with other team members, mentors, parents, and other teams. This means being a positive, helpful influence when asked, or politely excusing myself if unable to assist. I should be respectful to all peers, mentors, school administrators, and volunteers associated with FIRST robotics.

- **Be respectful in all conversations and group discussions**
  - Listen to other people when they are talking.
  - Only one person talks at a time.
  - The discussion must not dominated by any one person.
  - If your ideas are repeatedly not being embraced, listen to why this is, and stop presenting ideas until you learn from listening to others what does work for the team.
  - Discussions, while they may be spirited, are based on the content of ideas and opinions, not on personalities.
  - If there is a difference in opinion, work together to resolve the dispute, solve a problem, create a plan, make a decision, find principles all can agree on, or come to a conclusion from which it can move on to further discussion.
- Tool sets like the Allen wrenches and PWM kits need to be kept together.  If you are not willing to keep them together, don’t use them
- Everyone needs to pitch in and help with packing for trips and events to make sure we have the correct gear and supplies.  This especially means the main team contributors, because they know what the key components are for the robot.

### Commitment

I agree to take an active part in the team. I agree to work hard, show up at meetings, be willing to learn, and be open to new ideas.

I commit to good attendance and punctuality. Absences and tardiness may result in loss of team privileges. I agree to notify the team leadership in advance if unforeseen circumstances prevent me from meeting this commitment.

I commit to maintaining my grades and attendance in school, and if I do not maintain them, I will be asked to focus on improving those before returning to robotics.

### Expectations

I understand that the team expects me to contribute at the highest level of my ability, and that in order to be an involved member of the team I understand that I need to make a commitment to spend a minimum amount of time at meetings. If at any time I have a problem meeting team expectations, I agree to discuss with the team leadership in order to resolve the situation and ensure that both the team and I are benefiting from the relationship.

I agree to discuss my expectations for my involvement in the team with the team leadership. If at any time during the season I am having a problem with another team member or with the team, I agree to bring this to the attention of the leadership.

I understand that there are many skills required for a successful robotics team. I agree to work with the team leadership and the mentors to find a position that I find fulfilling and fun.

:::caution Sharing Media

**The team controls access to photos, videos, designs, and documentation to maintain our competitive advantage.** Do not share any photos, videos, designs, or documentation outside of the team (this includes but is not limited to posts to Chief Delphi, a FIRST robotics forum) without approval by the team leadership council. Example, do not post any pictures of our robot on Chief Delphi that were not taken at a competition without team leadership council approval. And even with approval, do not post pictures or videos of our robot that contain any other team's robot taken outside of competition events

You can, however, send photos or videos to people on the team private Google group or blog.

:::

- If you move or use something, please put it back in its rightful place when done using it
- **Work in a clean environment**. A clean and organized workspace is a more productive place to work, and fewer things get lost. 
  - Pick up every day.
  - Clean the floors if needed.
  - Please put tools away after using them.
  - Stop during the middle of a work meeting and clean up if needed.
  - If mentors are cleaning, stop and help them or do it for them.
  - If asked, stop whatever you are doing and clean up.
  - Show up and actively participate in lab cleanup and organization meetings.

### Safety

I agree to comply with all safety rules posted by the team leadership without exception. Safety is everyone’s first priority, and everyone needs to be looking out for potentially unsafe situations. Unsafe situations must be reported to adult leaders. Repeated unsafe behavior will result in dismissal from the team.

- **All safety rules and instructions need to be followed**.
- **Safety glasses** are to be worn when required, namely in the manufacturing room.
- **To use tools in the lab**, students and mentors must
  - Have agreed to and signed the Team Contract.
  - Have signed the consent and liability release form.
  - Have their emergency contact information on the list in the lab.
- **Non-team members are not allowed to use the tools.**
- Prevent trip hazards by not stringing wires, power cords, and other things across walkways
- Prevent slip and fall hazards by keep the walkways and floors clear and dry
