# Code of Conducts & Safety

Working on robots is definitely a lot of fun, but that fun can only be had if we ensure its happening in safe &amp; respectful environments so everyone can get the most out of it. We have guidelines that everyone should follow to ensure a safe environment when working with potentially dangerous tools, as well as conduct rules for both students and their parents or guardians.

Please make a point to read through the following sections, as mentors and team leaders will be ensuring the team is following the rules set forth.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
