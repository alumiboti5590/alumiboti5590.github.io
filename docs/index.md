# Introduction

Welcome to the Alumiboti's team documentation. Here you will find formatted and updated
resources that intend to persist over the years. The goal is that this documentation will
become an ever-evolving resource to help our mentors, team members, and even _other_ teams
navigate all of the complex mindsets, processes, and resources around competiting in [the
FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

## Who are the Alumiboti?

The Alumiboti are FIRST Robotics team 5590 based out of [St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute](https://www.sjci.com) in Buffalo, New York. We are a team focused on developing individuals into the best versions of themselves through innovation, creativity, and fun!

## What is FIRST?

[_FIRST_](https://www.firstinspires.org/), which stands for “_For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology_”, is a nonprofit organization founded by Dean Kamen in 1989. Structured around a high-school robotics competition, the FIRST Robotics Competition is much more than just a competition, combining **gracious professionalism** with technology to create an environment that fosters a deeper appreciation for science and technology. Professional mentors as well as college students partner with teams to teach students valuable engineering and professional skills while helping the team succeed.

Furthermore, FIRST teams are encouraged to spread the word to increase appreciation of Science, Technology, Engineering & Math in society as a whole.

In addition to the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) that the Alumiboti competes in, FIRST also sponsors [the FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc), designed for high school teams that may not have the resources to participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition. For younger students, FIRST has developed [the FIRST Lego League program](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll).

### Gracious Professionalism

**Gracious Professionalism** is part of the ethos of FIRST.  It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work,  emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the  community.

With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual  gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete  like crazy but treat one another with respect and kindness in the  process. They avoid treating anyone like losers. No chest thumping tough  talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, competition,  and empathy are comfortably blended.

### Coopertition

At FIRST, **Coopertition** (`Cooperation + Competition`) produces innovation. Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. Coopertition is founded on the concept and a philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete. Coopertition involves learning from teammates. It is teaching teammates. It is learning from Mentors. And it is managing and being managed. Coopertition means competing always, but assisting and enabling others when you can.
